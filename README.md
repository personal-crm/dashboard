# AngularJS dashboard

![screenshot](screenshots/dashboard.jpg)

Fully featured dashboard built with AngularJS. This project is ideal to start an AngularJS app using [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) and [bower](http://bower.io/).
It's greatly inspired/copied from [rdash/rdash-angular](https://github.com/rdash/rdash-angular) but adapted with other tools and with more features.

With this template you will have :

- a login system already setted (see [AuthSrv](https://github.com/loicknuchel/angularjs-dashboard/blob/master/app/scripts/services.js))
- an advanced logging & tracking errors system (see [_log.js](https://github.com/loicknuchel/angularjs-dashboard/blob/master/app/scripts/_log.js))
- CRUD helper for standard REST webservices & [Parse](https://parse.com/)
- many helpers such as [filters for dates](https://github.com/loicknuchel/angularjs-dashboard/blob/master/app/scripts/filters.js), [crud builders](https://github.com/loicknuchel/angularjs-dashboard/blob/master/app/scripts/common/crud-rest-utils.js), [storage helpers](https://github.com/loicknuchel/angularjs-dashboard/blob/master/app/scripts/common/storage.js) and many more...
- usefull libs already included :
    - [moment](http://momentjs.com/) for date manipulation
    - [lodash](http://lodash.com/) for functionnal utility helpers on collections
    - [localForage](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage) for async browser storage
