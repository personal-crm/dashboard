# Personnal CRM

This app aims to help you with your commercial prospection, follow ups & networking.
I didn't found a CRM that fit my needs, so I coded my own :D

## Getting started

- clone the repo `git clone git@github.com:loicknuchel/networking-crm.git`
- go to project folder `cd networking-crm`
- rename `app/scripts/_config-sample.js` to `app/scripts/_config.js` and add your parse keys
- run `npm install`
- run `bower install`
- run `grunt serve`
- You're setup with a shiny livereload :D

## TODO

- Integrate APIs :
    - [fullcontact](https://www.fullcontact.com/)
    - Gmail
    - Linkedin
    - Mandrill
- linkedin newtwork cartography & research
